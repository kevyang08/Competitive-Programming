Note: still need to implement

Idea:
- build tree by recursively splitting region by median point
    - on even levels (starting at level 0), split horizontally (by vertical line)
    - on odd levels, split vertically (by horizontal line)
- at each level, the children nodes represent the two regions that were split from the current region
    - sorted by non-decreasing order of respectice coordinate, so same as BST
    - if a region only has one point, then it is simply represented by that point
- to query regions, we can simply keep checking if the current region intersects with the queried region, no matter the shape
