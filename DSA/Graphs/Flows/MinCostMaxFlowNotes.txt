Similar idea to Edmonds-Karp, but using the cost as the distance instead of the number of edges
Using Bellman-Ford, the runtime is O(Fmn), where F is the total flow, m is the number of edges, 
and n is the number of nodes. 
Using Dijkstra's can reduce this to O(mn + Fmlogn)

Note that in this case, we do not want to combine edges
